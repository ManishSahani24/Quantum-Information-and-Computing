But the physical world is Quantum Mechanical, and therefore the proper problem is the simulation of Quantum physics — which is what I really want to talk about.***"

**How powerful is Quantum computer as compared to Classical Computer?**

1) The easiest way I can give an idea about it is : Let say you posses my public key but not my private key, a quantum computer could potentially compute the corresponding private key. A classical computer would take time longer than the age of universe for current cryptographic system.
   
2)  For an unstructure database of $N$, a classical computer requires $O(N)$ operations to find a target, whereas a quantum computer can do it in $O(\sqrt{N})$. The Grover's algorithm that we will be looking at.
